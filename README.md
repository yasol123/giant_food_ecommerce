# giant_food_ecommerce
For my employer, I built an ecommerce to serve online customers those who run a restaurant, caf√© bakery or deli store. This website is built by Django and Vue.js for a full-stack development

#Run

#1. Front-end (Vue)
npm i
npm run runserve

URL: http://localhost:8080/

#2. Back-end (Django)

python manage.py runserver
Since the frontend components were developed in Vue.js, you can visit and take a look at the admin page at https://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
